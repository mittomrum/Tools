#  🎯 Initial Project Folders - Unity Editor Tool for Initial Project Setup

This is my firest Unity Editor tool that makes it easy to set up your project folders and get started with game development quickly. With just one click, you can create a set of default project folders for your scripts, art, and scenes.

## How it works

To use this in your project, simply copy the ToolsMenu.cs file into your Unity project's Assets/Editor folder. Once you've done that, you'll be able to access the "Tools > Setup > Initial Project Folders" option from the Unity Editor menu.

This is an simple and effective tool that can save you time and hassle during project setup. Try it out today and get started with game development!
